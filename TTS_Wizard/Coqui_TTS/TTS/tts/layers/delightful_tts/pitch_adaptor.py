    """Module to get pitch embeddings via pitch predictor

    Args:
        n_input (int): Number of pitch predictor input channels.
        n_hidden (int): Number of pitch predictor hidden channels.
        n_out (int): Number of pitch predictor out channels.
        kernel size (int): Size of the kernel for conv layers.
        emb_kernel_size (int): Size the kernel for the pitch embedding.
        p_dropout (float): Probability of dropout.
        lrelu_slope (float): Slope for the leaky relu.

    Inputs: inputs, mask
        - **inputs** (batch, time1, dim): Tensor containing input vector
        - **target** (batch, 1, time2): Tensor containing the pitch target
        - **dr** (batch, time1): Tensor containing aligner durations vector
        - **mask** (batch, time1): Tensor containing indices to be masked
    Returns:
        - **pitch prediction** (batch, 1, time1): Tensor produced by pitch predictor
        - **pitch embedding** (batch, channels, time1): Tensor produced pitch pitch adaptor
        - **average pitch target(train only)** (batch, 1, time1): Tensor produced after averaging over durations
